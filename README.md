PasswordProtection
==================

Store and encrypt passwords

This is a simple program allowing you to store passwords based on a service (e.g., Facebook), and a username for that service (e.g., jimboslice@mailcom.net). The passwords are encrypted and stored in an SQLite database.

Upon first running the program, you will be prompted to enter two passwords (these are your global passwords), which are hashed together to form a key for encrypting passwords you enter for individual services. You will need to enter these passwords in the boxes at the top of the window whenever you store or retrieve your service passwords
